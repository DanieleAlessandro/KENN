## KENN: Knowledge Enhanced Neural Networks
KENN (Knowledge Enhanced Neural Networks) is a library built on top of TensorFlow that permit to enhance neural networks models with logical constraints. It does so by adding a new final layer, called **Knowledge Enhancer (KE)**, to the existing neural network. The KE change the orginal predictions of the standard neural network enforcing the satisfaction of the constraints. Additionally, it contains **clause weights**, learnable parameters associated to the constraints that represent their strength.
